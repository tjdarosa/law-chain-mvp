# law-chain-mvp
MVP for a business proposal designed in "blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies" course at UFSC. The idea is a hibrid system that uses a traditional database to store files and uses blockchain to keep integrity and auditability of these files.

## PHASE 1: Project Planning & Structure

### 1.1 Entities (Organizations)
Each role with decision power typically maps to an organization:

- CollectingOfficerOrg
- CustodianOrg
- ProsecutorOrg
- ForensicOrg
- CourtroomPersonnel will not have an org (read-only, via API).

Each org will have its own MSP (Membership Service Provider) and peer nodes, except CourtroomPersonnel.

### 1.2 Define the Network Topology
Ordering Service: 
- Raft with at least 3 Orderer nodes (best practice).

Peer Nodes:
- 1â€“2 peers per org (minimum: 1).
